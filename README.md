# PyBer Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to categorize ride-sharing data by the following city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural (cities) to investigate trends in fares and rides for each city type. A graph and dataframe summary are used to the convey findings. 

# Results
The ride-sharing data (see PyBer summary dataframe image link below) among different city types show that the average fare per ride and per driver are largest in rural cities compared to urban and suburban cities. However, in rural cities the number of total rides, total drivers and total fares are significantly fewer. 

By contrast, urban cities have the smallest average fare per ride and per driver but have the greatest number of total rides, drivers and fares by far. The overall quantity of urban rides make this city type have the highest in overall fares at $39,853.38 versus $19,356 for suburban, and $4,327.93 for rural.   

Suburban city type data run in between rural and urban city type data across the board or dataframe info (see both PyBer Summary dataframe image and Multi-line graph image links below).

# Summary
Based on the analysis, the disparities lead to these business recommendations - 
1. Based on population density, it is no surprise urban city types have the largest number of rides, drivers and fares. Further analysis is required to determine if more drivers and/or more city routes and a fare increase are in order. The greatest revenue is in this city type (10 times more than rural and about 2 times more than suburban). In addition, the graph shows urban peaks in March and April which should be further investigated for causes that could be replicaated and/or additional resources which may be allocated based on trends.  
2. Based on the total fares for suburban cities which are about half of urban cities, the total of suburban drivers is about 25% of total drivers for urban cities while the total rides for suburban are about 3x less than total rides for urban. This may indicate an opportunity for growth by adding more drivers to suburban city types. 
3. Based on the overall data for rual city types, with total fares and rides being 10 times and 13 times respectively less than total fares and rides of urban cities, resource priority should be the lowest for rural city types.
